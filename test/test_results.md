# Certificate Management Test Results

## Test Run: 2025-02-05 01:48:09
Overall Status: ❌ Failed (0/3 tests passed)

## 1. Temporary Certificate Tests (test_temp_certs.sh)
Status: ❌ Failed
Error: Syntax error in script
```
./test_temp_certs.sh: line 55: syntax error near unexpected token `}'
./test_temp_certs.sh: line 55: `    }'
```
Remediation Required:
- Fix shell script syntax error around line 55
- Verify function closure syntax
- Check for missing opening braces or extra closing braces

## 2. Certificate Generation Tests (test_cert_generation.sh)
Status: ❌ Failed
Error: Command line flag not implemented
```
flag provided but not defined: -keygen
Usage of sssonector:
  -config string
    Path to configuration file (default "/etc/sssonector/config.yaml")
```
Remediation Required:
- Implement -keygen flag in sssonector binary
- Add flag to main.go command line parsing
- Update generator.go to handle certificate generation when flag is present
- Update documentation to reflect correct flag usage

## 3. Certificate Transfer Tests (transfer_certs.sh)
Status: ❌ Failed
Error: File path and SCP syntax issues
```
scp: /etc/sssonector/certs/{ca.crtclient.crtclient.key}: No such file or directory
```
Remediation Required:
- Fix SCP command syntax - missing spaces in file list
- Correct path should be: `{ca.crt,client.crt,client.key}`
- Verify directory exists before attempting transfer
- Add directory creation step if needed
- Add error handling for missing source files

## Critical Issues to Address

1. Code Implementation:
   - Add -keygen flag to main.go
   - Implement certificate generation functionality
   - Update command line parsing

2. Script Fixes:
   - Fix syntax error in test_temp_certs.sh
   - Fix file path formatting in transfer_certs.sh
   - Add proper error handling for missing directories
   - Add proper cleanup between test runs

3. Environment Setup:
   - Ensure /etc/sssonector/certs directory exists and is writable
   - Verify SSH access between systems
   - Verify permissions on certificate directories

## Next Steps

1. Fix Implementation:
   ```go
   // Add to main.go
   var generateCerts bool
   flag.BoolVar(&generateCerts, "keygen", false, "Generate SSL certificates")
   ```

2. Fix Script Syntax:
   ```bash
   # Fix in transfer_certs.sh
   scp "$SERVER_SYSTEM:$CERT_DIR/"{ca.crt,client.crt,client.key} "$CLIENT_SYSTEM:$CERT_DIR/"
   ```

3. Add Directory Creation:
   ```bash
   # Add to scripts
   ssh "$SERVER_SYSTEM" "sudo mkdir -p $CERT_DIR && sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) $CERT_DIR"
   ```

4. Re-run Tests:
   - After fixes are implemented, run tests individually to verify each component
   - Then run full test suite to verify integration

## Additional Notes

- The -keygen flag needs to be implemented before any certificate tests can pass
- Directory permissions and existence checks should be added to all scripts
- Consider adding verbose logging option to help with debugging
- Consider adding cleanup function to remove test artifacts between runs
