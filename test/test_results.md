# Test Results - Temporary Certificate Tests

## Overview
Test suite for verifying temporary certificate functionality in SSSonector, including basic operation, mixed mode, and concurrent connections.

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Temporary Certificate Test
- Generates temporary certificates
- Verifies certificate file permissions and content
- Tests server-client connection
- Validates TUN interface configuration
- Confirms data transfer
- Verifies certificate expiration handling

### 2. Mixed Mode Test
- Tests interaction between temporary and permanent certificates
- Verifies proper rejection of permanent certificates against temporary server
- Validates security boundaries between certificate types

### 3. Concurrent Connections Test
- Tests multiple simultaneous client connections
- Verifies connection management under load
- Validates proper cleanup on certificate expiration

## Key Improvements

### TUN Interface Handling
- Added initialization retries and validation
- Improved error handling for interface setup
- Added wait conditions for interface readiness
- Enhanced cleanup procedures

### Certificate Management
- Improved temporary certificate generation and validation
- Added proper permission handling
- Enhanced certificate expiration monitoring
- Added forceful cleanup on expiration

### Process Management
- Implemented proper process group handling
- Added forceful cleanup using SIGKILL
- Enhanced shutdown coordination between components
- Improved logging of shutdown sequences

## Lessons Learned

### For End Users
1. **TUN Interface Setup**
   - Ensure proper permissions on /dev/net/tun
   - User must be in the 'tun' group
   - May need to load tun kernel module (`modprobe tun`)

2. **Certificate Management**
   - Temporary certificates expire after 15 seconds
   - Do not mix temporary and permanent certificates
   - Ensure proper file permissions (600 for keys, 644 for certificates)

3. **Process Cleanup**
   - Use `pkill -9 -f sssonector` to force cleanup if needed
   - Check /tmp for leftover temporary directories
   - Monitor system logs for cleanup verification

### For Developers
1. **Interface Initialization**
   - Added retries and validation for robustness
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Added wait conditions for readiness

2. **Process Management**
   - Use process groups for cleanup
   - Implement proper signal handling
   - Add logging for debugging

3. **Testing Considerations**
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Verify proper cleanup
   - Test concurrent operations
   - Monitor resource usage

## Future Improvements
1. Add stress testing for high connection counts
2. Implement certificate rotation testing
3. Add network failure recovery testing
4. Enhance monitoring and metrics collection
5. Add automated performance benchmarking

## Test Environment
- Server: Ubuntu Noble (24.04)
- Client: Ubuntu Noble (24.04)
- Network: Local VirtualBox network
- Test Duration: ~2 minutes per full suite
