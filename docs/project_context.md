# SSSonector Project Overview

## Project Description
SSSonector is a secure SSL tunnel implementation designed for high-performance, reliable data transfer with strong security guarantees. The project focuses on providing a robust, cross-platform solution for encrypted network tunneling.

## Key Features

### TUN Interface-based Networking
- Direct kernel-level network interface integration
- High-performance packet processing with optimized buffer management
- MTU-aware data transfer with automatic fragmentation
- Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Resilient connection handling with automatic recovery
- Efficient chunked data transfer to prevent buffer overflow

### Certificate-based Authentication
- Strong x509 certificate validation
- Automated certificate rotation
- Support for custom certificate authorities
- Flexible certificate management options
- Five feature flags for certificate operations:
  * -test-without-certs: Run with temporary certificates
  * -generate-certs-only: Generate certificates without starting service
  * -keyfile: Specify certificate directory
  * -keygen: Generate production certificates
  * -validate-certs: Validate existing certificates

### Rate Limiting and Monitoring
- Bidirectional traffic shaping with configurable limits
- Comprehensive performance metrics collection
- SNMP integration for enterprise monitoring
- Real-time throughput analysis
- Accurate error tracking and reporting
- Detailed metrics for:
  * Bytes transferred in both directions
  * Connection status and health
  * Error rates and types
  * Resource utilization
  * Latency and throughput

### Cross-platform Support
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+, RHEL 8+)
  * Full TUN/TAP support
  * Systemd integration
  * SELinux compatibility
- macOS (10.15+)
  * Native network extension support
  * Automatic permission handling
- Windows (10, Server 2016+)
  * TAP-Windows adapter support
  * Windows service integration
