# SSSonector Disaster Recovery Implementation Guide

This document details how the disaster recovery system was created, serving as a reference for future AI planners who may need to create similar systems or modify the existing one.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Documentation Structure Creation
```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p docs/disaster_recovery/{project,backups/{source,configs,tests,qa_data},scripts}
```

Files created:
1. `project/project_state.md`: Documents current development status
   - SNMP monitoring implementation
   - Rate limiting feature status
   - Certificate management status
   - Core functionality state

2. `project/qa_environment.md`: Details QA environment
   - VM configurations (192.168.50.210-212)
   - Test data locations
   - Service configurations
   - Environment variables

3. `project/development_threads.md`: Tracks development work
   - Active development threads
   - Dependencies between components
   - Blocked items
   - Resource allocation

4. `project/recovery_instructions.md`: Recovery procedures
   - Environment setup
   - Project recovery
   - QA environment recovery
   - Validation steps

### 2. Script Implementation

1. `scripts/backup.sh`:
   - Source code backup
   - Configuration preservation
   - Test data archival
   - QA environment capture
   - Manifest generation
   - Verification steps

2. `scripts/restore.sh`:
   - Environment verification
   - Source code restoration
   - Configuration deployment
   - Test data recovery
   - QA environment setup
   - Build verification

3. `scripts/validate.sh`:
   - Environment validation
   - Build verification
   - QA environment checks
   - Service validation
   - Connectivity testing

### 3. Implementation Steps

1. Created Documentation:
```bash
# Project state documentation
write_to_file project_state.md
- Captured current development status
- Listed active work items
- Documented known issues
- Outlined next steps

# QA environment documentation
write_to_file qa_environment.md
- Detailed VM configurations
- Listed test scripts
- Documented environment variables
- Described service setup

# Development threads documentation
write_to_file development_threads.md
- Listed active threads
- Documented dependencies
- Tracked blocked items
- Allocated resources

# Recovery instructions
write_to_file recovery_instructions.md
- Detailed setup steps
- Listed recovery procedures
- Provided validation steps
- Included troubleshooting
```

2. Implemented Scripts:
```bash
# Backup script
write_to_file backup.sh
- Added source backup
- Implemented config backup
- Created test data backup
- Added QA environment backup
- Generated manifests

# Restore script
write_to_file restore.sh
- Added environment checks
- Implemented restoration
- Added validation
- Created summary output

# Validation script
write_to_file validate.sh
- Added environment validation
- Implemented build checks
- Created QA validation
- Added service checks
```

3. Made Scripts Executable:
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh restore.sh validate.sh
```

### 4. Testing Process

1. Backup Testing:
```bash
./backup.sh
- Verified directory creation
- Checked file preservation
- Validated manifests
- Confirmed permissions
```

2. Restore Testing:
```bash
./restore.sh
- Tested environment checks
- Verified file restoration
- Validated builds
- Checked services
```

3. Validation Testing:
```bash
./validate.sh
- Tested environment validation
- Verified build process
- Checked QA environment
- Validated services
```

## Key Components

### 1. Backup System
- Preserves source code
- Saves configurations
- Archives test data
- Captures QA state
- Generates manifests
- Validates backups

### 2. Restore System
- Verifies environment
- Restores files
- Rebuilds project
- Configures services
- Validates restoration
- Provides feedback

### 3. Validation System
- Checks environment
- Verifies builds
- Tests services
- Validates QA
- Reports status

## Usage Instructions

### Creating Full Backup
```bash
cd /home/sblanken/Desktop/go/src/github.com/o3willard-AI/SSSonector
./docs/disaster_recovery/scripts/backup.sh
```

### Restoring System
```bash
# Latest backup
./docs/disaster_recovery/scripts/restore.sh

# Specific backup
./docs/disaster_recovery/scripts/restore.sh 20250206_123456
```

### Validating System
```bash
./docs/disaster_recovery/scripts/validate.sh
```
